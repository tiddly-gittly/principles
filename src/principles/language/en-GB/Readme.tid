! <<lingo Name>>

<<lingo Description>>

This plugin allows you to record your life principles in the form of an outline, and engrave them in your brain like a mental steel stamp through spaced repetition technique, so that you can program yourself, learn from mistakes, and keep improving.

[ext[Principles|https://www.principles.com]] in the book is organized in tree structure, and I hope each could be linked from the diary or other notes, and revisit by [ext[Tidme plugin|$:/plugins/tidme/fsrs4tw]], so this plugin integrate the [[Streams plugin|$:/plugins/linonetwo/streams-outliner-lib]] to input the outline of principles.

!! Usage

<<open-principles-layout-button>>, you will see an outline UI provided by the [[Streams plugin|$:/plugins/linonetwo/streams-outliner-lib]].

After input, you can use the <<back-to-standard-layout-button>> button at the top left to return to the standard layout.
